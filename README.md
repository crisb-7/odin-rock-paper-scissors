# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is my submission for the Odin Project's JavaScript Foundations course project.

The game is played as a combination of browser alerts and console log messages. It's first to 5 and sends the correct messages for every case:

- When you lose a round: `"You lost this round!"` :smiling_imp:
- When you win a round: `"You won this round!"` :sunglasses:
- Score count every round you play until the game ends :worried:
- When you win the match: `"You won the game! \nThanks for playing!"` :sleeping:
- When you lose the match: `"You lost the game! \nThanks for playing!"` :rage:
